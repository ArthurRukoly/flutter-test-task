# Flutter developer

**Flutter version** - Flutter 3.27.3

## Requirements that are completed


### Technical
- Primary platforms - iOS & Android 
- Auto search - requests to retrieve Gif information from the service are made automatically with a small delay after user stops typing;
- Pagination - loading more results when scrolling;
- Vertical & horizontal orientation support;
- Error handling;

### UI
- Responsive & matching platform guidelines;
- At least 2 views sourced by data from Giphy;
- Results are displayed in a grid;
- Clicking on a grid item should navigate to a detailed Gif view.
- Loading indicators;
- Error display;

### Bonus points
- Using an understandable architecture pattern;
- Page navigation is separate from page widget code (a Coordinator pattern or similar);

### Requirements that are not completed
- Unit tests - as much as you see fit<br>
I couldn't research and learn about unit testing in provided time.

- Using state management approaches or libraries such as BLoC (flutter_bloc), Riverpod or others; <br>
Originally was Planned to implement it after completing default state management, but refactoring took too much time, and some features went missing (like pagination). This would require more research from my side.
